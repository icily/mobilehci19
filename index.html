    In this workshop, we intend to bring scholars and practitioners of MobileHCI conference who is interested in designing technology use for children and their parents. Parents are concerned with technology addiction for their children but generally feel loss of control in the ubiquity of mobile devices. We believe mobile design community can contribute meaningful ideas in this space. The goals of the workshop are:
      <ol>
        <li>Identifying the values, concerns, and challenges of children and their parents when they are engaged in mobile devices. </li>
        <li>Creating a design space for nuanced and bounded engagement for children and their family that designers can use to generate new mobile technology.</li>
      </ol>

    <h2>Topic</h2>
    <p>
      Parents are generally weary of giving their children mobile devices, afraid of opening a “Pandora Box” for their children. However, banning children’s technology use is increasingly difficult for parents as we live with ubiquitous mobile gadgets: a study revealed that 97% of children have used mobile device before age 1, and most of them own one of their own by the age of 4 [ref]. However, technology is often regarded as an unnecessary distraction for young children. Parents restrict children’s screen time because it is believed to be detrimental to their overall health development [ref], despite that some research did not find negative effects relating to screen time on children [ref]. But the notion that technology is detrimental to children is so prevalent that news outlets often compare mobile technology use to drug addiction among children [ref]. The popular media content embodies a collective anxiety among parents who do not know how to contain the ubiquity of technology in children's life.
    </p>
    <p>
    And the portrayal of such addiction is not without support. Scholars characterized the ways in which system design intentionally captures and holds users’ attention, intending for them to stay longer in the system [ref]. Furthermore, books serve as guidelines for software designers to keep users’ engagement and compulsive checking behavior [ref]. This is consistent with parents’ concerns that consumer facing digital applications are deliberately designed for extending the duration of usage. But other scholars found the scientific link between clinically defined addictive syndromes and social narratives of technology addiction weak, pointing out that avoiding technology in response to this fear may even do more harm than good [ref].  
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, The American Academy of Pediatrics guideline for screen time for children aged 2-5 is no more than 1 hour per day, with a parent’s presence and help [ref]. However, research [ref] points out that instead of imposing fixed screen time, contextual factors like parents’ uncertainties, locus of control, and functional uses of mobile devices need to be considered. In the HCI field, studies looking at how parents use technology with their children found that parents have multiple concerns over where, when, how, and what adults and children are using the digital device [ref]. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, the research in the space shows that parents’ consideration for their children’s mobile phone consumption is enacted situatedly and with a nuance approach to different contexts. We believe designers should take a nuanced approach as parents and children to reduce parents’ concerns and highlight the potential benefits technology may bring.

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
    Mobile technology usage in family is a constant negotiation between parents and children. Parents are concerned about their children’s wellness but often have rules around usage without a clear guidance. We believe mobile technology design community can contribute meaningful insights in the space. For example, by making the algorithms more tangible and understandable to the layman; enhancing the collaborative use between the parents and the children; Design for self-discipline for children; providing features for collaborative screen time monitoring between children and parents; and etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The goals of this workshop are organized around three themes:
    <ul>
      <li><div class="emphasis">Consider children’ and parents’ perspectives together and identify the gaps between their needs and current design paradigm.</div></li>
      <li><div class="emphasis">Creating a representation of design space of this gap for designers when they create nuanced and bounded mobile technology for families.</div></li>
      <li><div class="emphasis">Devising appropriate research methods and applying theories to study children/parent interaction with mobile technology.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Structure</h2>
    Morning
    <ul>
      <li>Casual sharing of each submitted work (talks, prototype demonstrations...)</li>
      <li>Group design sessions in groups with pencils and papers, and discussion</li>
      <li>Group presentation & Feedbacks to each other</li>
    </ul>
    
    Afternoon
    <ul>
      <li>Go through design insights from the morning & map out challenges and concerns that parents and children have</li>
      <li>Brainstorm whether a solution of a design considerations might be helpful or not to each challenge</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>User-Centered Design Sessions</h3>
        <p>Rethink how positioned projects can be applied for the use of children and their family members, from a child's perspective & from parents’ perspective.</p>

      <div>
        <img src="discussion.svg" alt="Discussions" />
        <h3>Discussions</h3>
        <p>What choices require special consideration in designing mobile technologies for children and parents? How research methods and design of mobile technology may contribute to the gap between parents’ anxiety of children’s mobile device usage and children’s nuanced engagement?</p>
